<h2>I'm a developer, and I like making things</h2>
<p>
    I'm currently based in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/QUhRTomS46KB2wGD7">Christchurch, New Zealand</a>, 
    and am in my final year studying Computer Science. I love to make things, 
    whether they be video games, websites (like this one), apps, simulations, visualisations... I could keep going. 
    While you're here you could check out the <a href="/projects">things I've made</a>, or more specifically 
    <a href="/games">my games</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently looking for work, if you interested head to <a href="about-me">About Me</a> 
    (or <a href="/assets/cv.pdf">here is my CV</a> directly).
</p>
<p>
    Also, if you click 'maximise' above, you can make the planets spin.
