  description: You are stuck in a small space ship, separated from your crew and all outside communication. Your only hope for escape is to survive long enough to create a distress beacon and attract a rescue party, but the required parts are scattered around the "abandoned" alien ship your crew mates so mysteriously disappeared into. Fortunately, you have remote control of a robot that can explore the alien depths while you struggle to survive. This is the (mostly) unaltered source code for the game I made with C# and Unity for the 37th Ludum Dare (late 2016), theme "One Room."
